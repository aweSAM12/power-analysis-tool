# Power Consumption Monitoring API

This project provides a Flask-based API for monitoring and querying the power consumption of specific processes over time, using the `powertop` tool. The API can be used to retrieve power consumption data for a given process ID (PID) over a specified time range (e.g., minutes, hours, days).

## Features

- **Continuous Monitoring:** The application logs power consumption data from `powertop` every minute.
- **Data Purging:** Logs older than 24 hours are automatically purged to maintain a manageable dataset.
- **API Access:** A Flask-based API allows querying the total power consumption of a specific process (PID) over a specified time range.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
